Explanation:
Abstract Pizza Class:

The Pizza class defines the common interface and methods like prepare(), bake(), cut(), and box() that all pizzas will use.
Concrete Pizza Classes:

NyStyleCheesePizza and ChicagoStyleCheesePizza are specific types of pizzas that extend the Pizza class. Each class defines its unique attributes such as name, dough, and sauce.
ChicagoStyleCheesePizza overrides the cut() method to cut the pizza into square slices.
Abstract PizzaStore Class:

The PizzaStore class contains the orderPizza() method, which manages the process of ordering a pizza. It calls the factory method createPizza() to get an instance of a specific pizza type, then prepares, bakes, cuts, and boxes it.
The createPizza() method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses.
Concrete PizzaStore Classes:

NyPizzaStore and ChicagoPizzaStore are concrete implementations of PizzaStore. They implement the createPizza() method to create specific types of pizzas based on the input type.
Main Class:

The PizzaFactoryMethod class demonstrates how to use the Factory Method pattern. It creates instances of NyPizzaStore and ChicagoPizzaStore, and orders cheese pizzas from each store.
